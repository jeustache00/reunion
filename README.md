# Réunion

Platform that provides a way for undocumented immigrants facing a raid to send vital information to love ones && || an immigration attorney

## Problem

- Raids pose serious risk to family’s immediate safety and long-term development (housing instability and food insufficiency)
- Deporting undocumented workers affect the US economy (10% - agriculture, construction, hospitality / leisure)
- Immigration raids increase taxes (on average, it costs $23K to deport one immigrant)
- Immigration raids are an insult to basic humanity
- Detainees can go days without medical treatment, are place in solitary confinement and suffer daily humiliation
- During raids, detainees cannot communicate with loved ones or access important legal documentation
